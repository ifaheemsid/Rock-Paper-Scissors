## WHERE TO FIND ANYTHING

- The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 
  This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

- You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.
